# Installs everything Odysseus needs via Homebrew, sets up a local Python
# environment, and launches the app — so a generic Mac user can run it without
# knowing anything about venvs, pip, or uvicorn. Safe to re-run; it skips work
# that's already done.
#
# Why native (not Docker): Cookbook serves models on whatever machine Odysseus
# runs on, and Docker on macOS is a Linux VM with no access to the Metal GPU.
# Running natively lets Cookbook detect and use your Mac's GPU.

# 2. Find a Python 3.11+ to build the environment with.
#    On Apple Silicon we require an *arm64* interpreter (Homebrew's, under

#    at /usr/local — produces a venv whose compiled extensions get loaded as the
#    wrong architecture when launched from the .app bundle (Cookbook then dies
#    with "incompatible architecture"). So on arm64 we only look under
#    /opt/homebrew and install Homebrew's python@3.11 if it's missing. On Intel
#    (or non-mac) we just use whatever Python 3.11+ is on PATH.

# System dependencies (each installed only if missing, so re-runs stay fast and

#
# tmux and llama.cpp are needed only by Cookbook (local model serving), not to
# boot the core app. So if Homebrew can't install one right now we warn and keep
# going instead of aborting the whole launch. Python is required to build the
# venv, so that one stays fatal (handled by the PY check just below).
